I have worked on several projects applying machine learning and deep learning as part of coursework, in my work, and for self-learning. Here are some of my personal data science projects.

### Brain tumor classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

In this project, I implemented CNNs for the classification of brain tumors from MRI images. I experimented with several CNN architectures, and also applied the LeNet-5 and ResNet architectures, as well as transfer learning with the VGG-16 model.  For hyperparameter optimization, I applied grid search cross-validation, random search and Bayesian optimization with the Keras Tuner, and AutoKeras. Here is my [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-learning-brain-tumor-classification-aruna-mohan/) describing this work. My code is available [here.](https://github.com/a-mohan1/CNN-image-classification)

### Time series analysis of air travel and the impact of COVID-19

I implemented time series forecasting methods based on autoregressive and moving average models to forecast air passenger numbers, for comparing against historical and recent data on air travel. Here is my [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-series-analysis-air-travel-impact-covid-19-aruna-mohan/) describing this project. My code is available at this [link.](https://github.com/a-mohan1/Time-series-analysis)

### Predictive modeling of car accidents in Seattle based on supervised machine learning

I applied classification methods based on logistic regression, kNN, decision tree classifiers, and  support vector classifiers, to predict car accidents using data available from the [Seattle DoT website](https://gisdata.seattle.gov/server/rest/services/SDOT/SDOT_Collisions/MapServer/0). Here is my 
[LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-modeling-car-accidents-seattle-aruna-mohan/) on this project, and my code is available [here.](https://github.com/a-mohan1/ML-Classification)
