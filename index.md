I leverage data science and computational science in my work to design new materials and processes.  

I earned my Ph.D. at MIT, where I conducted research on the mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation of complex fluids and polymers. Here is a video from one of my stochastic simulations:

As a postdoc, I developed and solved stochastic and field-theoretical models in C++ and MATLAB, and implemented reduced-order Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using an open source C++ MD package called [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/). Here is a video from one of my MD simulations:

More recently, I completed the MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science from MITx. Here is a video I made of particle dynamics, this time based on a Gaussian process flow simulation.

In my work in the battery industry, and previously in the materials and petrochemicals industry, I apply a combination of computational techniques (including physics-based modeling, molecular simulations and finite element based methods), statistical data analysis, data science and machine learning to design and optimize products and processes, using Python, C++ and MATLAB. 

Here are some of my personal data science projects:

- [Time series analysis of air travel and the impact of COVID-19](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-series-analysis-air-travel-impact-covid-19-aruna-mohan/)
- [Predictive modeling of car accidents in Seattle based on supervised machine learning](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-modeling-car-accidents-seattle-aruna-mohan/)
