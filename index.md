I leverage data science and computational science in my work to design new materials and processes.  

I earned my Ph.D. at MIT, where I conducted research on the mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation of complex fluids and polymers. Here is a video from one of my stochastic simulations:

As a postdoc, I developed stochastic and field-theoretical models, and reduced-order Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using C++ LAMMPS. Here is a video from one of my MD simulations:

More recently, I completed the MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science from MITx. Here is a video I made of particle dynamics, this time based on a Gaussian flow simulation.
