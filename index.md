I leverage data science and computational science to design and optimize novel products and processes. In my work spanning the materials, biomedical and energy industries, I have been applying a combination of physics-based computational methods, statistical data analysis, data science, machine learning and deep learning for technology development, using Python, C/ C++ and MATLAB. 

I earned my Ph.D. at MIT, where I conducted research on the mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation of complex flows. Here is a video of DNA dynamics in a microfluidic device from one of my stochastic simulations:

As a postdoc, I developed and solved stochastic and statistical mechanical models of biomolecules and polymers in C++ and MATLAB, and implemented reduced-order Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/), an open source C++ MD code. Here is a video of polymer dynamics from one of my MD simulations:

More recently, I completed the [MITx MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science). Here is a video of particle dynamics that I developed for a project, this time based on a Gaussian process flow simulation in Python:

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, watching documentaries and reading. My favorite travel destination so far has been [Heraklion](/assets/images/knossos.JPEG), which I was inspired to visit by [this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00tcvzl/episodes/guide) awesome documentary.
