I leverage data science and computational science in my work to design new products and processes.  

I earned my Ph.D. at MIT, where I conducted research on the mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation of complex flows. Here is a video from one of my stochastic simulations:

As a postdoc, I developed and solved stochastic and statistical mechanical models in C++ and MATLAB, and implemented reduced-order Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/), an open source C++ MD code. Here is a video from one of my MD simulations:

More recently, I completed the [MITx MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science). Here is a video of particle dynamics that I developed for a project, this time based on a Gaussian process flow simulation in Python.

In my work in the battery industry, and previously in the materials and chemical industry, I have been applying a combination of computational techniques (including physics-based modeling, molecular simulations and finite element based methods), statistical data analysis, data science and machine learning to design and optimize materials and processes, using Python, C++ and MATLAB.
