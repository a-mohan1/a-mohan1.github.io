I leverage data science and computational science in my work to design new materials and processes.  

I earned my Ph.D. from MIT, where I conducted research on the mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation of complex fluids and polymers. Here is a video from a stochastic simulation:

As a postdoc, I developed stochastic and field-theoretical models, and reduced-order Molecular Dynamics simulations using C++ LAMMPS. Here is another video from a stochastic simulation:

More recently, I earned the MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science from MITx. [Here](/assets/images/n200pb3.mpg) is another video of particle dynamics, this time based on a Gaussian flow simulation.

Here are some of my personal projects:

- [Time series analysis of air travel and the impact of COVID-19](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-series-analysis-air-travel-impact-covid-19-aruna-mohan/)
